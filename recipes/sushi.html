    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists 
        of vinegared rice, combined with a 
        variety of ingredients such as raw fish, 
        vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It's often served with condiments like soy sauce, wasabi, 
        and pickled ginger. The rice is the central element, and itâ€™s seasoned with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and 
        salt to give it a distinct flavor.</p>
